An R package for analyzing historical land use and population on a regional to global scales. It includes functions to download HYDE 3.2 and Anthromes-12k data (from the Anthromes-12k-DGG repository at <https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/E3H3AK>), apply the anthromes classification, extract raster data using an equal-area discrete global grid system, and generate common summary tables and visualizations. 

It is based on (and supersedes) the R research compendium used to generate the analyses and figures for:

> Ellis, E.C., N. Gauthier, K. Klein Goldewijk, R. Bliege Bird, N. Boivin, S. Diaz, D. Fuller, J. Gill, J. Kaplan, N. Kingston, H. Locke, C. McMichael, D. Ranco, T. Rick, M.R. Shaw, L. Stephens, J.C. Svenning, J.E.M. Watson, (2021). *People have shaped most of terrestrial nature for at least 12,000 years*. PNAS.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nick-gauthier/anthromes")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(anthromes)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

This package is currently in development, with submission to rOpenSci planned shortly. In the interim, please cite the original R compendium at:
