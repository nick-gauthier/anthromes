Description: An R package for analyses of contemporary and historical land use 
    and population on a global scale. Includes functions to download HYDE 3.2 
    and Anthromes-12k data (in both 5â€™ and Discrete Global Grid versions from 
    the Anthromes-12k-DGG repository at <https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/E3H3AK>), 
    apply the anthromes classification routine, extract data to an equal-area 
    DGG system, and generate common summary tables and visualizations.
