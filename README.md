# anthromes: Analyzing global population and land use in R

[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)

An R package for analyses of contemporary and historical land use and population on a global scale. Includes functions to download HYDE 3.2 and Anthromes-12k data (in both 5â€™ and Discrete Global Grid versions), apply the anthromes classification routine, and generate common summary tables and visualizations. 

It is based on (and supersedes) the R research compendium used to generate the analyses and figures for:

> Ellis, E.C., N. Gauthier, K. Klein Goldewijk, R. Bliege Bird, N. Boivin, S. Diaz, D. Fuller, J. Gill, J. Kaplan, N. Kingston, H. Locke, C. McMichael, D. Ranco, T. Rick, M.R. Shaw, L. Stephens, J.C. Svenning, J.E.M. Watson, (2021). *People have shaped most of terrestrial nature for at least 12,000 years*. PNAS.
